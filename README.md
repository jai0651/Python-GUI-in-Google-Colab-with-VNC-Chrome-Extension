## Design Decisions
noVNC client viewer, Tightvnc server


## Instructions to Run your Program
extension is working fine. 



## Other Notes:
The main problem occured was setting up vnc server in colab. vnc server is working on my localhost but not on colab. Other than that i did everything. Exposing localhost to internet via ngrok. Actually i tried almost everything , it seems like Colab has removed features to connect remotely may be. If you guide a bit, i will be able to do this completely and integrate every functionality
